          <p>I am a Sophomore Computer Engineering student at York College of Pennsylvania. Throughout college, I have developed skills in computer programming languages such as Java and C. I have also developed in circuit design, circuit analysis, and digital circuits, through coursework, breadboarding, labs, and projects.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I am dedicating my time and focus to studying computer engineering at York College. I am excited to learn more about the industry and get started working in a software engineering position this summer at Becton Dickinson. Be sure to check out my projects section to learn more about the projects that I have completed!</p>
